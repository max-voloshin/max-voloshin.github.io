        Hi to all, my name is Max Voloshin.
    </p>
    <p>
        I graduated from the faculty of Applied Mathematics.
        Currently I am the leader of a small team that makes a <a href="http://www.bi.owox.com/">cool product</a> :)
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2010 I started working at <a href="http://www.owox.com/">OWOX</a> as PHP developer.
        I took part in bootstrapping online stores with use of OWOX Engine.
        Also I improved existing functionality of the platform and created lots of new.
        One of my activities was creating educational materials for the company’s developers.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2012 I have been promoted to the leader of a team, since then I am engaged in improving efficiency of my team,
        "degreasing" of business requirements, development of architectural solutions,
        integration of best practices of development to the team’s culture, code review and mentoring.
    </p>
    <p>
        In my free time I am seeking opportunities to develop a software more efficiently and effectively.
    </p>
    <p>
        I really like FOSS and <a href="https://github.com/max-voloshin?tab=activity">contribute to some projects</a>
        from time to time.
    </p>
    <p>
        My values ​​in product development: quality, continuous delivery, optimal ratio of development cost and business value.
