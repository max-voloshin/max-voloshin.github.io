        Hi to all, my name is Max Voloshin.
    </p>
    <p>
        I graduated from the faculty of applied mathematics.
        Currently I am leader of small team that makes <a href="http://www.bi.owox.com/">cool product</a> :)
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2010 I started to work in <a href="http://www.owox.com/">OWOX</a> as PHP developer.
        I took part in bootstrapping online stores with usage of OWOX Engine.
        Also I improved existed functionality of platform and created the new one.
        One of my activities was creating educational material for company’s developers.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2012 I have been promoted to leader of team, since I am engaged in improving the efficiency of the team,
        "degreasing" of business requirements, development of architectural solutions,
        integration of best practices of development to team’s culture, code review and mentoring.
    </p>
    <p>
        In free time I am seeking opportunities to develop software more efficiently and effectively.
    </p>
    <p>
        I really like FOSS and <a href="https://github.com/max-voloshin?tab=activity">contribute to some projects</a>
        from time to time.
    </p>
    <p>
        My values ​​in product development: quality, continuous delivery, optimal ratio of development cost and business value.
    </p>
