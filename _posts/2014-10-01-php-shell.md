## Why PHP developers should know about Shell?

PHP developers deal with web development in most cases, where start point is request to web server.
In spite of this we work with Shell:

* we use a terminal emulator:  iTerm / Gnome Terminal / Konsole / xterm / etc
* we log to remote machine via ssh
* we use such PHP function as ``exec`` / ``shell_exec`` / ``system`` / ``passthru`` / ``proc_open`` or backtick operator `` `...` ``
* we create command line interface to own application for ability to automate routine actions  

In order to do these tasks more effectively, worth looking the details of intersection of PHP and Shell.

## What is Shell?

Shell – interpreter of command line language which is determined by POSIX standard.
There are couple of implementations:

* Original Bourne Shell – **sh** – used in most UNIX systems
* Bourne Again Shell – **bash** – used in most Linux systems
* Debian Almquist Shell – **dash** – used in Debian
* Z Shell – **zsh** – used by advanced users of command line :)
* etc

## Running PHP application from Shell

{% highlight php %}
<?php //sapi.php
echo PHP_SAPI . PHP_EOL . php_sapi_name() . PHP_EOL;
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight sh %}
$ php sapi.php
cli
cli
{% endhighlight %}

Thus we can determine run via Shell with constant ``PHP_SAPI`` or function ``php_sapi_name``.

## Shell variables and environment variables

We can use variables in Shell:

{% highlight sh %}
$ FOO=value
$ echo $FOO
value
$ BAR='another value'
$ echo "$FOO and $BAR"
value and another value
{% endhighlight %}
